Version 1.0
Date: June 23, 2025
1. Introduction
This document describes the primary user flows for the Casino Analytics Module. It illustrates the step-by-step paths that different user roles will take to accomplish key tasks within the system. These flows are derived from the functional requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Document (v1.1).
User Roles:
Analyst: Read-only access to all data and reports.
Manager: Read access, plus the ability to log and track machine movements.
Administrator: Full system access (flows are generally the same as the Manager, but with added administrative rights not covered in these flows).
2. Core User Flows
Flow 2.1: Login and Dashboard Overview (All Roles)
This flow describes the initial entry into the system and the user's first view of the overall performance data.
User navigates to the CMS login page and enters their credentials.
System authenticates the user via the core CMS authentication service.
Upon successful login, the User is directed to the main CMS portal.
User clicks on the "Analytics" tab in the main navigation menu.

User sees the four main KPI cards (Total Handle, Total Win/Loss, etc.) and the interactive map with colored pins representing each location's performance.
User hovers over a pin on the map.
System displays a tooltip with the Location Name and its Total Handle.
User clicks the date filter and selects "Last 30 Days."
System refreshes all dashboard components (KPI cards, map pin colors) to reflect the new date range.
Flow 2.2: Comparative Location Performance Analysis (Analyst/Manager)
This flow describes how a user compares the performance of several locations against each other.
From the main navigation, User clicks on the "Location Analytics" section.

User repeats steps 3-5 to add "Strikey's Funhouse" and "Ocean's Edge Gaming" to the comparison.
System updates the Summary Table and Trend Charts. The charts now show three distinct colored lines, one for each location.
User examines the "Top 5 Machines" table for the "Strikey's Funhouse" location and clicks on the "Actual Hold" column header.
System sorts the machine list for that location by "Actual Hold" in descending order and displays a "down arrow" icon in the header.
User clicks the "Export" button and selects "PDF."
System generates and initiates a download for a PDF file containing a visual snapshot of the current comparison view.
Flow 2.3: Detailed Machine Performance Comparison (Analyst/Manager)

User clicks the checkbox next to three different machines (e.g., GM1, GM5, GM12) to select them for comparison.
System opens a detailed comparison view, showing a metric table and performance charts for only the three selected machines.
User reviews the "Contribution Summary" section, which displays statements like "15% of the machines contribute to 65% of the Total Handle."
User clicks the "Export" button and selects "RAW (CSV)."
System generates and initiates a download for a CSV file containing the detailed time-series data for the three selected machines.
Flow 2.4: Logging a New Machine Move (Manager Role)
This flow is restricted to Managers and Administrators.
Manager clicks on the "Machine Logistics" or "Audit" section in the main navigation.

System displays a form.
Manager selects the Machine ID from a searchable dropdown. The "From" location field is auto-populated and made read-only.
Manager selects the "To" Location from a dropdown list.
Manager selects the "Date of Move" using the calendar picker.
Manager enters the name of the staff member who physically moved the machine in the "User who moved the machine" text field.
Manager adds a note: "Machine moved to a higher traffic area as per Q2 strategy."
Manager clicks the "Save Move" button.
System validates the form, saves the record to the immutable audit log, and displays a success message. The new entry is now visible at the top of the movement history log.
Flow 2.5: Auditing a Machine's Movement History (Manager/Administrator)
This flow describes how a user reviews the historical movements of a specific machine.
Manager navigates to the "Machine Logistics" section.
System displays the complete, paginated list of all machine movements, sorted by date descending.
Manager uses the search bar at the top of the table and types in a specific Machine ID.
System filters the table in real-time to show only the movement records for that specific Machine ID.
Manager can now see the complete chronological history of where that machine has been, when it was moved, and by whom, providing a full audit trail.
