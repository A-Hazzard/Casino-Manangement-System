# Tooltip Positioning Issue - Games Performance Revenue Chart

## Issue Description

The tooltip on the "Games Performance Revenue" chart is positioned too far above the chart bars when hovering over data points. The tooltip appears with excessive vertical spacing between itself and the bars it represents, making it difficult to visually connect the tooltip information with the corresponding chart data.

## Current Behavior

When hovering over bars in the Games Performance Revenue chart:
- The tooltip appears positioned significantly above the hovered bar
- There is a large gap between the tooltip and the chart bars
- The tooltip feels disconnected from the data it represents
- The positioning makes it harder to quickly associate the tooltip content with the specific bar being hovered

## Expected Behavior

The tooltip should:
- Appear closer to the chart bars with minimal vertical spacing
- Maintain a reasonable distance that allows easy visual connection between the tooltip and the hovered bar
- Be positioned consistently with other charts in the application (Games Performance and Manufacturers Performance charts)
- Provide a clear visual relationship between the tooltip content and the corresponding chart element
- Feel naturally positioned relative to the hovered data point, not floating far above it

## Context

This issue specifically affects the "Games Performance Revenue" chart. The other charts (Games Performance and Manufacturers Performance) appear to have appropriate tooltip positioning that should serve as a reference for the expected behavior.
