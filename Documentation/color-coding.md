## 📊 Key Metrics

These are the main metrics used to assess casino location performance:

- **Gross Revenue**: Earnings retained by the casino after payouts.
- **Drop**: Total cash or token input into the machines.
- **Cancelled Credits**: Credits that were cancelled by players or systems.
- **Online Machines**: Number of machines actively online vs total available.

## 🎨 Color Coding System

The color indicators represent different levels of performance based on thresholds.

| Color | Meaning               | Description                               |
| ----- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 🟢    | Excellent Performance | Significantly exceeds performance targets |
| 🔵    | Good Performance      | Meets or slightly exceeds expectations    |
| 🟡    | Average Performance   | Acceptable but shows room for improvement |
| 🔴    | Poor Performance      | Below expected performance levels         |

## 🧮 Performance Calculation

The core calculation for assessing revenue performance is:

**Revenue Performance (%) = (Gross Revenue / Drop) × 100**

### Example Calculation:

- **Gross Revenue** = $230,340
- **Drop** = $1,894,900

**Revenue % = (230,340 / 1,894,900) × 100 ≈ 12.15%**

## 📘 Suggested Thresholds

| Revenue % | Color Code | Performance Level |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| > 20%     | 🟢 Green   | Excellent         |
| 15% – 20% | 🔵 Blue    | Good              |
| 10% – 15% | 🟡 Yellow  | Average           |
| < 10%     | 🔴 Red     | Poor              |

In the example above, a 12.15% return would fall under 🟡 Average Performance.
